# SVP-generator
Processes CTD data and creates a Sound Velocity Profile for a water column, and displays a graph of the SVP.

Notes:
Only Valeport (.000) CTD files are supported for now. I will add seabird later.
Only Sonardyne (.pro) SVP files can be generated for now. I will add an option for Kongsberg files later.
Am currently working on a GUI for this application.
